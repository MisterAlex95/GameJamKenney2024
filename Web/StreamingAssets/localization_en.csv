60,+Thanks for that. We have a first question for you.
61,+What did you do this morning before the body was found?
62,I did a pretty heavy clean of the ground floor before taking about two hours to read my book.
63,Ian needed the kitchen, so it was better to let him the space to cook. But I stayed with him so we can have some time together.
64,+Ok, thanks. We will come back if you have more questions more you.
// Object Loops
65,Let me a bit of time please, it is a hard day, but don’t hesitate to go around the house in the meantime.

75,+Livia really went to the movies until the end.’
76,+Wait something is odd with this ticket.

// Dialogues
78,+We need a bit more elements from you. We only saw tablewares for two in the living room. Where did you eat for lunch?
79,Indeed, I didn’t had lunch here today. I went to the restaurant in town with my friend Norah at noon.
80,I only came back at 1.10pm after I got a call from Ian telling me about Maddy.
81,+Do you have any receipt to prove it?
82,Unfortunately no, Norah paid for me as I was in a hurry.
83,+Hello, we are Alex and Mary from Camden.
84,Hello, I’m Ian Pumin. How can I help you?
85,+We are investigating on Ms. Thomas sudden death by trying to recreate everyone’s schedule.
86,+What did you do this morning between 8am and 1pm?
87,I understand that you need to suspect me as well, but I mainly slept until I heard a big noise downstairs.
88,+We have a new question for you Mr. Pumin. Downstairs we found only tablewares for two.
89,+Where did you eat for lunch?
90,I started to cook as soon as I got up and then ate with Livia around noon.
91,But it seems like I took too much time preparing the food as there are a lot of leftovers.
92,+Hello, we are Alex and Mary from Camden.
93,Hello, I’m Livia Sumner. How can I help you?
94,+We are investigating on Ms. Thomas murder and need to ask you some questions.
95,+You slept with her last night. Was she awake this morning when you got up?
96,Actually I woke up around 8am and went downstairs to have breakfast with my friend Daniel.
97,Before leaving Maddy was still sleeping in the bed.
98,+The Police told us that you were the one who discovered the corpse. Can you tell us a bit more about that?
99,Sure, I was eating lunch with Ian when I heard my phone ringing in the guest room. I went up and that’s when I discovered Maddy.
100,+We have a last question for you. What were you doing before lunch?
101,I went to the movies for the 9.30am film show. I came back right after that back here.
// Outro
102,+We need to gather everybody in the hall. It seems like we know what happened.
103,+Thank you all for coming here.
104,+We took the liberty to bring you all together as we managed to solve the mystery behind Maddy Thomas’ death.
105,+The Police will join us as soon as they can.
106,Does that mean that we really have a killer among us?
107,+Yes. And we even thank this person because we had enough clues to discover its identity quickly.
108,Can we at least sit before your announcement?
109,+No, we prefer to stay here and proceed directly, so the Police will be able to intervene as soon as they arrive.
110,+We need to say that after retracing all of your activities from this morning everything seemed pretty normal.
111,+Sure we had doubts because each of you had opportunity to kill Ms. Thomas at one point.
112,+But you all had proofs that you didn’t lie. All except one.
113,+Mr. Daniel Putin we know you are the one that killed Maddy.
114,Are you really accusing me? Maddy was one of Ian’s best friends, I could never have done that.
115,I hope you believe me sweetheart, I love you.
116,I try to, but one of us really did that and it is not me. And what about you Livia?
117,+Ms. Sumner you don’t have to respond to this question.
118,+We know that you didn’t kill your roommate as you were either with someone in the house either to the movies.
119,+Same for you Ian, either you were asleep, either you were with someone else. The only one with a false alibi is you Daniel.
120,+You indeed ate breakfast with Livia, but after she left you cleaned just a little bit.
121,+You then took this opportunity to concoct the poison and give Maddy a sleeping pill so you were sure that she won’t wake up.
122,+But you did a little too much noise doing all that and it woke Ian up.
123,+You had to stay in the kitchen because you needed to let your mixture still for an hour and make sure that Ian won’t discover it.
124,+You manage to plan a last minute lunch with a friend that never came.
125,+You said that you ate a lot but the receipt we found only contains a starter and you paid it at 12.15pm.
126,+So you had enough time to come back and kill Maddy. Ian and Livia didn’t hear you because the door was closed and they were chatting.
127,+You gave her the potion saying you just cooked something and you wanted her to try it.
128,+You left in a hurry because you shouldn’t be seen that early in the house.
129,+That’s when you didn’t took enough time to clean behind you.
130,+After that you waited for Ian’s call a few streets further and came back like you never left the restaurant before.
131,I’m sorry Ian, but I had to kill her, because
132,+Save your words for the Police, they are coming.
