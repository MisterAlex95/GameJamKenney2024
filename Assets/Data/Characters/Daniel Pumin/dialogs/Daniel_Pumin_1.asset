  - +Thanks for that. We have some questions for you.
  - +What did you do this morning before the body was found?
  - I did a pretty heavy clean of the ground floor before taking about two hours
    to read my book.
  - 'Ian needed the kitchen, so it was better to let him the space to cook. But I
    stayed with him so we can have some time together. '
  - '+Ok, thanks. We will come back if you have more questions more you. '
