  dialogText:
  - +We need a bit more elements from you. We only saw tablewares for two in the
    living room. Where did you eat for lunch?
  - "Indeed, I didn\u2019t had lunch here today. I went to the restaurant in town
    with my friend Norah at noon and only came back at 1.10pm after I got a call
    from Ian telling me about Maddy."
  - +Do you have any receipt to prove it?
  - Unfortunately no, Norah paid for me as I was in a hurry.
